//! Transport-agnostic views of wallet state.
//!
//! These types are what [`crate::bmp_wallet::BMPWallet`] hands back to callers that need to
//! *describe* the wallet (a GUI, an RPC layer) rather than *drive* it. They deliberately hold
//! `rust-bitcoin` types rather than protobuf ones, so the `wallet` crate stays free of any
//! dependency on a particular wire format; mapping to protobuf happens in the `rpc` crate.
